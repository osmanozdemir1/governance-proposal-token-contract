# Sample Hardhat Project

This project contains the solution scripts of the week 7 of Alchemy University Ethereum Developer Bootcamp. To be able to run this hardhat project you need to create a .env file and add URL and Private Key in that file (!!! Don't forget to add .env to the .gitignore !!!). 

In the /scripts folder you can deploy, execute, make proposal and vote. You need to change the address variables when you deploy your own contract.
